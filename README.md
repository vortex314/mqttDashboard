# mqttDashboard
## Goal
- Make it simple to create an MQTT custom Dashboard for your application.
- A single fxml ( based on JavaFX ) configuration file should be needed to design this.
- SceneBuilder from Gluon can be used to use a drag and drop approach in building this file
- Thanks to the excellent work in the Medusa JavaFX library , there are a lot of customizable Gauges availabel.
All tweaking and settings of these controls remain possible.
